My heart aches more than words can show.
I wish I could be there, wipe your tears away,
Hold your hand, and make the pain sway.

Every moment apart feels heavy,
And I ache to comfort you, to steady
Your trembling spirit, your gentle smile,
I'm praying for you, every mile.

May each breath bring strength anew,
And health and healing wrap around you.
Until I can be by your side once more,
Know my love is with you, as I adore.`
